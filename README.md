A virtual reality Street Fighter game, built with [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) and [Kinect](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/kinect).


Goals
-------
* Fight with gestures and a combat system. Gestures for offense include punching forward, blocking with arm up, counter with a side gesture, and, of course, ability to charge and shoot a Hadoken fireball.
* Fighters have a heads-up display on your arm, telling you how much health you have, how much charge you have. When your health runs out, you lose.
* An iPad renders the street-fighter scene in real time, using data from the Kinect and the two Myos.

Potential features
--------------------

* Fireball has vertical angle, so it may miss if it's too far away from opponent (using gyroscope data for angle, and accelerometer data for speed).
* Indicator for when you are within *close combat range* – when you are in this range, you can punch and counter.
* Different levels of charge for the Hadoken fireball – you build up charge by punching and doing successful blocks.
